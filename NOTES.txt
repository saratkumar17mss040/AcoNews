Pagination and full article content is not available in free tier
Using json-server to simulate api endpoint as to not waste resources while developing
Since no access to see the endpoint for pagination, will build one using json-server

For frontend steps:

npm run dev - by default vite will take .env.development
npm run build - by default vite will take .env.production
firebase deploy - to deploy frontend to firebase

 A summary of your experience, your victories, and that one time you cried when it didn’t compile (we’ve all been there).

 My experience include working with html, css, js apps building freshworks marketplace apps - jibble, ziwo.
 I also have exposure over react and building rest-api services.
 Mentored a lot of experienced and new people helping them to code and debug issues.
 There was one time when i was trying to fix some jsx syntax, it kept on giving errors. finally, i figured out the issue.
 Most often, checking the codeflow and debugging will help. Even after that not able to resolve, take a break and comeback. we will
 be able to resolve it. If not, ask for help from peers. Apply the learning...
